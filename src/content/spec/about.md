# About Me

My interest in cybersecurity began during the pandemic, when I became curious about the hidden flaws in game servers. On a Minecraft server run by a content creator, I noticed a server-side exploit caused by a misconfigured plugin. It was not something I reported officially, but exploring how and why it happened sparked my interest in vulnerabilities and problem solving. That curiosity has only grown since then.  

Since that time, I have studied IT with a focus on ethical hacking through Hack The Box, where Iâ€™ve developed hands-on skills in vulnerability detection, penetration testing, and network security. Building projects like a Pwnagotchi and learning about database management, SQL, and data protection legislation have strengthened my foundation.  

One of my achievements so far is earning a Certificate of Achievement in Cyber Security from the British Transport Police. Even though I was limited by an NDA, this experience showed me the importance of professionalism in complex security work.  

Outside of cybersecurity, I enjoy listening to podcasts such as *Darknet Diaries* and *Hacked*, watching creators like Network Chuck, gaming, and going to the gym six times a week to stay balanced.  

I am currently looking for job opportunities and open to connecting with mentors who can guide me as I develop my career in cybersecurity. My long-term goal is to become a penetration tester and make a meaningful contribution to a safer digital world.
